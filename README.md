# MAP estimator for $m$-QAM constellations

Here we give a brief introduction on Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation and its direct application to communication with discrete modulation (QAM constellations)

The first example consistis on communication over an AWGN channel with an equiprobable regular 9-QAM constellation, in which we plot the constellation, the transmitted, received and estimated symbols.
Next, we plot the decision regions for equiprobable and non-equiprobable contellations.
